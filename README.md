## 1. Introduction to C++

C++ is a powerful, high-performance language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. It's widely used for system/software development, game programming, drivers, client-server applications, and embedded firmware.

---

## 2. Setting Up C++ Development Environment

Before you start coding in C++, you need to set up a development environment. Some popular options include:

- **IDE**: Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, CLion, Eclipse.
- **Compiler**: GCC, Clang, MSVC.

To compile a C++ file using the command line (GCC):
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

---

## 3. Basic Syntax and Structure

A basic C++ program includes headers, a `main()` function, and statements inside the function.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 4. Variables and Data Types

C++ supports various data types like `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, and `bool`. You can declare variables to store data.

### Example:
```cpp
int age = 25;
float temperature = 36.5;
char grade = 'A';
bool isEligible = true;
```

---

## 5. Operators in C++

C++ supports a wide range of operators, such as arithmetic, logical, comparison, and bitwise operators.

### Example:
```cpp
int x = 10, y = 5;
int sum = x + y;
bool comparison = (x > y);
```

---

## 6. Control Flow

Control flow statements like `if`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while` help control the execution flow of a program.

### Example:
```cpp
if (x > 5) {
    cout << "x is greater than 5" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "x is 5 or less" << endl;
}
```

---

## 7. Functions in C++

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

### Example:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int result = add(10, 5);
    cout << "Sum: " << result << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 8. Arrays and Strings

Arrays are used to store multiple values of the same type, while strings are a sequence of characters.

### Example:
```cpp
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
string name = "John";
```

---

## 9. Pointers and References

Pointers store the memory address of a variable, and references are an alias for an existing variable.

### Example:
```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;   // Pointer to x
int& ref = x;    // Reference to x
```

---

## 10. Dynamic Memory Allocation

In C++, you can allocate memory dynamically using `new` and `delete`.

### Example:
```cpp
int* arr = new int[5]; // Allocating array dynamically
delete[] arr;          // De-allocating memory
```

---

## 11. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP allows you to structure programs as classes that contain both data and functions. It supports key concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

### a. Classes and Objects
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    string model;
    void drive() {
        cout << model << " is driving." << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.model = "Tesla";
    myCar.drive();
    return 0;
}
```

### b. Inheritance
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        cout << "Animal speaks" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};
```

### c. Polymorphism
```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() {
        cout << "Drawing shape" << endl;
    }
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing circle" << endl;
    }
};
```

---

## 12. Templates in C++

Templates allow functions and classes to operate with generic types.

### Example:
```cpp
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

---

## 13. Exception Handling

C++ provides a structured way to handle errors using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`.

### Example:
```cpp
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (const exception& e) {
    cout << "Error: Division by zero" << endl;
}
```

---

## 14. File Handling in C++

You can read from and write to files using `fstream`, `ifstream`, and `ofstream`.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <fstream>
ofstream file("example.txt");
file << "Hello, World!";
file.close();
```

---

## 15. Algorithms in C++

### a. Sorting Algorithms
```cpp
sort(arr, arr + n); // Built-in C++ sorting
```

### b. Searching Algorithms
```cpp
bool found = binary_search(arr, arr + n, key);
```

### c. Dynamic Programming
```cpp
int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}
```

### d. Graph Algorithms
Graph algorithms include depth-first search (DFS), breadth-first search (BFS), and Dijkstra's shortest path.

---

## 16. Standard Template Library (STL)

The STL provides ready-made generic classes and functions, such as `vector`, `list`, `map`, `stack`, and `queue`.

### Example:
```cpp
vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
numbers.push_back(5);
```

---

## 17. Multithreading in C++

C++11 introduced multithreading capabilities through the `<thread>` library.

### Example:
```cpp
#include <thread>

void threadFunction() {
    cout << "Thread is running" << endl;
}

int main() {
    thread t(threadFunction);
    t.join(); // Wait for the thread to finish
    return 0;
}
```

---

## 18. Advanced C++ Concepts

### a. Smart Pointers
Smart pointers automatically manage memory, preventing memory leaks.

### b. Move Semantics
Move semantics optimize resource management by "moving" resources instead of copying them.

### c. Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are anonymous functions defined within the code.

### Example:
```cpp
auto add = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };
cout << add(3, 4) << endl;
```
